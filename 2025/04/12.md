Got assaulted again yesterday. Months ago I was backed against the wall like a suspect after being assault. This time I am literally being arrested after being assaulted while the perpetrators walked free.

It's not really surprising. What's there to expect?

I was told that I could leave after hours. My properties was returned to me outside the police station. I realised only then my devices were seized. And with that it means they are making me, the victim, the suspect, while their perpetrator freinds are protected.

The reason for them to seized my devices cannot be good. Like mentioned many times before, they have an extreme surveillance on me. And with that they watch how I suffer in all kind of absurd things such as being drugged arbitray, and surely include the assaults, guess what the connections are. There is no way they need them for any proper investigation.
